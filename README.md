# Mandy Lloyd — Frontend Engineer Portfolio

A React-based portfolio showcasing frontend architecture, accessibility-driven development, and component-level engineering work across federal and design system projects.

Built to demonstrate systems thinking, validation logic, UI resilience, and modern JavaScript patterns — not just visual output.

---

## Overview

This portfolio highlights selected work across:

- React multi-step form architecture
- State-driven conditional rendering
- Accessibility (WCAG + Section 508 alignment)
- Validation logic and UX behavior
- Component refactoring and design system contributions
- Frontend debugging and layout resilience

Each project includes curated examples, screenshots, and focused code snippets to reduce reliance on external PR navigation.

---

## Tech Stack

- React (v18+)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (custom properties + design tokens)
- Component-driven architecture
- Accessible interaction patterns
- Git

Optional enhancements:
- Scroll-triggered CSS animations (view-timeline)
- Pixel-mask reveal effect (CSS mask + transform)
- Reduced-motion support

---

## Design Philosophy

This site intentionally balances:

- Professional clarity
- Accessible contrast and focus states
- Minimal visual noise
- Subtle interaction energy
- Controlled use of accent colors

Primary accent: Violet  
Secondary accent: Teal (interaction states only)  

Motion is used sparingly and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Accessibility

Accessibility considerations include:

- Semantic heading hierarchy
- Proper ARIA usage where appropriate
- WCAG AA contrast compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus-visible states
- Reduced motion fallback

Accessibility is treated as a baseline requirement, not a feature.
